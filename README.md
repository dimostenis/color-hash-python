# color-hash

**Generate a color based on a value**

This module generates a color based on an object, by calculating a color value
based on a hash value for the object. This means the result is deterministic:
the same value will always result in the same color (so long as the hash
function remains deterministic).

This module is a port of the [color-hash Javascript library](https://github.com/zenozeng/color-hash).

It supports Python 3.7+ and it has no dependencies.

## Quick Start

```python
>>> from colorhash import ColorHash
>>> c = ColorHash('Hello World')
>>> c.hsl
(131, 0.65, 0.5)
>>> c.rgb
(45, 210, 75)
>>> c.hex
'#2dd24b'
```

## Installation

Its hosted on PyPI.

```bash
pip install colorhash
```
